### Checkout hours

The next guests arrive at 4pm.
_When checking out, we ask you to leave the lodge before 10am so that we can clean and prepare it._

A simple call and we will come to you.
We will carry out a quick inventory together when you give me the keys back.

### Cleaning

The cleaning and bedding are included in the price.  

However, we ask you to:
- Gather the bedding and bathroom linen in the hallway, making a pile for each. The draw sheets stay on the beds.

- Take out the bins in the dustbin location on the car park.
Two containers for glass and plastic waste are also at your disposal on the same spot.

- Tidy the kitchen and the tableware.

All the cleaning equipment (broom, mop, vacuum cleanerâ€¦) is at your disposal in the laundry room.
